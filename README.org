Wombag is a Wallabag client for Emacs.

[[https://wallabag.org/][Wallabag]] is an (optionally self-hosted) Read-It-Later and archiving service for web pages, like Pocket or Instapaper.

* Installation

*Please Note*: Wombag requires at least Emacs 28.1 and a recent-ish server-side installation of Wallabag (v2.6.0 or higher).  You can check your Wallabag version from the web interface.

Install using your package manager of choice, or clone this repo and run =package-install-file= on the cloned directory.

* Setup and Usage

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package wombag
  :config
  (setq wombag-host "https://app.wallabag.it" ;where you access Wallabag
        wombag-username "my-wallabag-username"
        wombag-password "my-wallabag-password"
        wombag-client-id "abcdefgh1234"
        wombag-client-secret "abcdefgh1234"))
#+end_src
Consider obfuscating your password and client secret here using =auth-source= or some other mechanism.  There are other customization options, which see.

To use it, run =wombag=.

Run =wombag-sync= to sync the local database.  It may take a while the first time.

** In the Wombag buffer

If you have used [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][Elfeed]] before you should feel at home.

- Press =s= to search for articles, =?= for help when searching.
- Sync with the server with =wombag-sync= (=G=).
- You can archive (=A=), star (=F=), tag (=+=) or delete (=D=) entries.
- Removing tags is not supported yet.

** Anywhere in Emacs

To add a URL to Wallabag, you can run =M-x wombag-add-entry=.

* Quality of life features

Wombag provides a few QoL features.

*** Full-featured text search

You can filter the search listing incrementally using any combination of criteria.

In this demo I filter the listing to articles that mention /Julia/ in the title, added between /2021/ and /2023/, are not archived, and contain the text /automatic differentiation/:

# #+begin_export html
# <p align="center"><video preload="metadata" style="center" width="768" controls>
# <source src="./wombag-search.mp4">[VIDEO]</a></video></p>
# #+end_export

You can search by text, tags, title, author, URL, date published, date added, starred/archived status and more.

*** Saves your place

Wombag saves your place in articles.  You can also show only partly-read articles when searching (press =?=), or call =M-x wombag-resume= from anywhere.

*** =imenu= support

Jump between article sections with =imenu=:

# #+attr_html: :width 800px
# [[file:images/wombag-imenu.png]]

The above image is with =consult-imenu=.  Any =imenu=-based command will work (including just =imenu=).

*** Bookmark support

You can bookmark search results or individual articles.

*** TODO Org-link support

(Not yet implemented)

* How it works

Wombag uses a local sqlite database to store your Wallabag entries and Emacs as a front-end.  Remote to local syncing is incremental and based on the last sync time.  Local changes are propagated to the remote instantaneously and requires an Internet connection.

* Comparison with [[https://github.com/chenyanming/wallabag.el][wallabag.el]]

I needed something that could work smoothly with my decades-old reading list of 15K+ articles.  I could not get  =wallabag.el=, a pre-existing Wallabag client for Emacs, to sync correctly or to work without freezing Emacs.  This is a smaller, stripped down rewrite of the package  -- no code is shared except for a couple of face definitions.

- =wallabag.el= has many features Wombag doesn't: annotation support, ivy integration, image caching,  bulk action support via marking entries and more customization options.
- Wombag has a 12-25x lower memory footprint, more consistent syncing and graceful error handling, better search and many quality of life features.

For more information on the differences see [[https://github.com/chenyanming/wallabag.el/issues/21][this thread]].

* Known issues

- Deleting articles from the web interface or a different client will not cause them to be deleted from the local database when syncing.  This is a known limitation of the Wallabag API.  This can be done by doing a full (as opposed to incremental) sync, which Wombag does not (officially) support.  Note that all local changes (including deletions) are always reflected server-side.

- Removing tags is not implemented due to Wallabag [[https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/6928][API issues]].
